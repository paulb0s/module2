<p>
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore &#8212;<br>
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door &#8212;<br>
Only this and nothing more."
</p>
<p>
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
From my books surcease of sorrow &#8212; sorrow for the lost Lenore &#8212;<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore &#8212;<br>
Nameless here for evermore.
